<h1 style="text-align: center"><strong> DELIVERY INFORMATION</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>
  When your purchase anything from Louisville Overstock Warehouse, either online
  or at our weekend sale, you can choose to pickup the item yourself or to use
  our local delivery service. If you choose delivery, we offer professional,
  local delivery service right to your home for a separate charge.
</p>
<p>
  Standard delivery within Jefferson County, KY or Clark/Floyd County, IN is
  $50-$125 depending on items purchased. Large purchases of multiple rooms of
  furniture typically add $25 per room.
</p>
<p>
  Additional charges apply for deliveries outside of Jefferson County, KY or
  Clark/Floyd County, IN, in order to cover extra time &amp; fuel costs. This
  surcharge of $25 is assessed per county line of distance.
</p>
<p>
  Our primary delivery range is within 50 miles of the Louisville/Clarksville
  area; however, deliveries outside this area may be available and can be
  quoted.
</p>
<p>
  The delivery fee pays for the delivery truck to come out one time. If your
  order has a mix of in-stock and out-of-stock items, delivery will occur once
  all items have been received into the delivery warehouse.
</p>
<p>
  The delivery schedule operates Monday – Saturday from about 10am – 4:30pm
  though actual appointment times that are scheduled will vary based on delivery
  address and order size. They will contact you directly to set up an
  appointment for delivery, and they provide a 2-hour window several days in
  advance of the actual delivery.
</p>
<p>
  On the day of delivery, the delivery service will also provide contact when
  they are at least 15 minutes away from your residence.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >To reschedule a confirmed delivery, contact the sales warehouse ASAP. A
    cancelled delivery within 48 hours of the scheduled and confirmed delivery
    appointment could result in a handling fee. A no-show on a confirmed
    delivery appointment will result in a re-delivery fee.</i

<h2 style="text-align: center">ASSEMBLY INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
  Some minor assembly by the customer is required on most furniture items, such
  as screwing legs on a sofa, or attaching the back of a recliner to its base.
  Minor assembly requires no tools. However, some furniture items are delivered
  in carton, and require more involved assembly. If you are able to assemble it
  yourself, you will save money on your purchase.
</p>
<p>
  Should you require assembly assistance for other items, the delivery service
  may provide this for an additional fee. Ask your sales representative for more
  information when setting up your delivery, or ask the delivery service when
  they call to the night before delivery to arrange a time.
</p>
