    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">LOCAL PICK UPS</h2>
    <p>We request that all purchases be picked up within 7 days of when we notify you of availability for pickup. Due to the
        constant flow of merchandise in and out of our warehouses, we cannot store your merchandise for an extended period.
        Layaways and/or purchases of in-stock merchandise that are not picked up within 30 days will, at our option, be
        converted to an in-store credit. Special orders not picked up within 30 days will be considered a cancellation of
        order, any amount paid (minus the 50% deposit) will be converted to an in-store credit. The 50% deposit is
        non-refundable. This non-refundable fee helps us to recoup the cost of placing your custom order, paying for it's
        shipping costs, warehousing it when it arrives, making room for it on our sales floor, transferring it to our sales
        floor and finally, waiting for the custom piece to sell. Orders that have been converted to in-store credits cannot
        be refunded. We pre-inspect all outgoing furniture to ensure that when it leaves our building it's free of damage
        and defects. Any damage that occurs during customer pickup &amp; transportation is the sole responsibility of the
        shipper and/or purchaser. Occasionally, manufacturer defects may not get caught at inspection (usually this is
        related to assembly of a piece, like holes mis-drilled, part doesn't fit, etc.). If you notice a manufacturer
        defect, contact us immediately. We will do everything possible to restore your piece to new condition in as short a
        time as possible. Please be aware that replacement merchandise and replacement parts may have to be special ordered
        from the manufacturer and may take some additional time to arrive. Please keep the original packaging in case the
        item needs to be returned/exchanged.
